# Image-Classification-using-TensorFlow

A neural network model designed for addressing a fundamental image classification task.

The aim is to develop and train a model capable of taking an image of a handwritten digit as its input and providing a prediction for the digit's class, effectively determining either the digit itself or its corresponding class based on the input image.
